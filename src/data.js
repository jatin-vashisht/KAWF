    text: `Animal Rescue becomes a difficult task when there is passion in the
        work being done, but with no means of sustenance. This is the case in
        most animal rescue centers, especially in Kashmir. Almost all centers
        are volunteer-based, non-profit organizations. Most of the animals
        they rescue are terribly injured, wrought with maggots, living in
        pathetic conditions without water or food. Can we even say that they
        are “living”, when the situation is so dire? To fulfill these demands
        the centers need: food - at least twice a day for each animal at the
        shelter medications - which are expensive and scarcely in many areas
        of Kashmir, special items - like baby formula for newborns, ambulances
        for traveling to rescue the animals, space - for making a shelter,
        which they scarcely have, the list is endless. And the source of
        money? Their own pockets. A major issue the animal centers face hence
        becomes the dire lack of funds. This stems from the lack of awareness
        in the region about the need and importance of Animal Rescue. 01 Most
        centers resort to paying for the towering bills themselves. They get
        rescues, care for them in the best possible way, pay an immense
        amount, get more rescues and this cycle goes on till one day, they
        can’t do this anymore. Donations are paramount for running animal
        rescue centers. They need help, so they can help. So the maggot
        infested dog, the cat who got badly bitten, the horse that lost its
        leg, the pup who got abandoned, can all get the help they deserve.`,

    text: `Animals deserve as much help and support as humans do. We have some
        goals focused on this very thought. A lifetime sanctuary for animals
        with permanent disabilites Fully operational diagnostic center and
        dispensary A surgical unit for immediate and on-going surgeries A
        mobile treatment unit for on-spot medical attention Ambulances
        Training programs for paravets and other non-technical staff Awareness
        programs in schools, colleges and offices Collaboration with print,
        digital and analogue media partners for running awareness and
        information programs Establishment of a quick response team for cases
        reported by locals A quick response helpline - experienced volunteers
        can give online support and guide people who want to help animals in
        need. We seek to ultimately provide the animals in Kashmir with the
        same treatment and care as humans receive, but none of this will be
        possible without your help. Click here, to support us. (link to
